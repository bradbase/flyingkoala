Worked Example - BoM (Bureau of Meteorology)
============================================

The worked example for the bom module demonstrates the use of FlyingKoala User Defined Functions for importing data from files.

Excel file name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the name of the workbook file. This setting is expected to auto-fill.

In the future we expect to be able to load models from other Excel files which is why this configuration is here.
