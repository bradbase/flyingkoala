Quickstart
==========

This guide assumes you have FlyingKoala and xlwings already installed. If that's not the case, head over to :ref:`installation`.

1. Using the FlyingKoala modules
--------------------------------

This is the "essentially no code" way of using FlyingKoala.

Providing the operations you are expecting to use already exist in the FlyingKoala library you can simply import them.

Follow the instructions from xlwings to install that plug-in into your workbook.

Make sure you have the dependencies installed for the FlyingKoala module you want to use. Notes on this can be found in :ref:`installation`.

For calculating Growing Degree-Days you would have a module that would look like this:

.. code-block:: Python

  import xlwings as xw
  from flyingkoala import *
  from flyingkoala.horticulture import *

For doing some time series transformation you would have a module that would look like this:

.. code-block:: Python

  import xlwings as xw
  from flyingkoala import *
  from flyingkoala.series import *

For doing some time series transformation while calculating Growing Degrees-Day you would have a module that would look like this:

.. code-block:: Python

  import xlwings as xw
  from flyingkoala import *
  from flyingkoala.horticulture import *
  from flyingkoala.series import *

2. Freestyling with FlyingKoala
--------------------------------
If the functionality you want isn't yet supported in a FlyingKoala module, you'll need to write your own (and maybe put it forward to be included in FlyingKoala :D).

At this point all FlyingKoala can offer is an easy interface to Koala2.

.. code-block:: Python

  import xlwings as xw
  from flyingkoala import *
